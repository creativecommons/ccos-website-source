description: We ask that contributors to Creative Commons (CC) projects submit
a pull request with your changes. If you're not familiar with pull requests,
please read [this GitHub documentation][github-pr]. Here are our expectations
for pull requests; following them will expedite the process of merging your
code in.
[github-pr]: https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests

body:

Read and follow the contributing guidelines and code of conduct for the project. Here are screenshots of where to find them for [first time contributors](first-time-contributor-resources.png) and [previous contributors](previous-contributor-resources.png).

We aim to review pull requests within five business days.<a href="#footnote-1"><strong>*</strong></a>. If it has been over five business days and you have not received any feedback, feel free to follow up with us.

* **Make A Branch**
    * Please create a separate branch for each issue that you're working on. Do not make changes to the default branch (e.g. `master`, `develop`) of your fork.
* **Push Your Code ASAP** 
    * Push your code as soon as you can. Follow the "[early and often](https://www.worklytics.co/blog/commit-early-push-often/)" rule. 
    * Make a pull request as soon as you can and **mark the title with a "[WIP]"**. You can create a [draft pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests).
    <br/>

* **Describe Your Pull Request**
    * Use the format specified in pull request template for the repository. **Populate the stencil completely** for maximum verbosity.
        * Tag the actual issue number by replacing `#[issue_number]` e.g. `#42`.
          This closes the issue when your PR is merged.
        * Tag the actual issue author by replacing `@[author]` e.g. `@issue_author`.
          This brings the reporter of the issue into the conversation.
        * Mark the tasks off your checklist by adding an `x` in the `[ ]` e.g. `[x]`.
          This checks off the boxes in your to-do list. The more boxes you check, the better.
    * Describe your change in detail. Too much detail is better than too little.
    * Describe how you tested your change.
    * Check the Preview tab to make sure the Markdown is correctly rendered and that all tags and references are linked. If not, go back and edit the Markdown.

* **Request Review**
    * Once your PR is ready, **remove the "[WIP]" from the title** and/or change it from a draft PR to a regular PR.
    * If a specific reviewer is not assigned automatically, please [request a review](https://help.github.com/en/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review) from the project maintainer and any other interested parties manually.
* **Incorporating feedback**
    * If your PR gets a 'Changes requested' review, you will need to address the feedback and update your PR by pushing to the same branch. You don't need to close the PR and open a new one.
    * Be sure to **re-request review** once you have made changes after a code review.
    <br/>

    * Asking for a re-review makes it clear that you addressed the changes that were requested and that it's waiting on the maintainers instead of the other way round.
