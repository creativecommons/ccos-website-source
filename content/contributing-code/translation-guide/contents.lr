description: Our translation files are hosted and managed on
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com). It is very easy to sign up for an
account and start translation Creative Commons (CC) services into another
language.

body:

CC applications such as CC Search and the CC Chooser are used by millions of
users worldwide. Translating these services into the languages our users speak
and read is integral to making these services accessible to our diverse user
base.

We use Transifex to manage our translation files. It provides an intuitive UI
and many useful tools. Let's see how you can join us there and get started.

TL;DR: We have a [video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rta2AlPww8M)
of this tutorial if you prefer that as the medium of instruction.

    remain to be translated. Here onwards you have three paths for translating
    the site.
    - Transifex editor UI, by clicking the 'Translate' button
    - Transifex live UI, by clicking the 'Live' button

- **Method 1: Translating using the Transifex editor UI**
  - To do this, click on the 'Translate' button from the resource modal. You
    will be taken to a list of all the strings from the website.
  - Switch the language to your target language using the menu bar on the upper
    side of the screen.
  - Click on any string, enter the translation in the lower box and click the
    'Save Translation' button to commit the change.
  - Some text has HTML tags in it. In those cases you can click on the tags in
    the source text to copy them over in the translated text. You can also drag
    to move them around as needed.

- **Method 3: Translating strings locally**
  - To do this, you can download the JSON file that maps English strings to
    their counterparts in your language by clicking the 'Download file to
    translate' button.
  - For the untranslated strings, both key and value will be the same.
    ```json
    { "Hello, World!": "Hello, World!" }
    ```
  - Change the JSON values to the translated text.
    ```json
    { "Hello World": "नमस्ते, दुनिया!" }
    ```
  - Upload the translated JSON file using the 'Upload file' button.

Your translations will go live as soon as they are approved by the admins.
