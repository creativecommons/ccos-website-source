For the context, I am working with my mentor [Timid Robot](https://creativecommons.org/author/timidcreativecommons-org/) on Creative Commons WordPress Plugin in GSoC 2019. It is basically an attribution tool, allowing users to attribute their content and include a CC license on their WordPress website.

GSoC is about to end, and I am excited that we have the plugin ready with all the possible attribution features.
 We had a stable version of the plugin up and running in the last phase. This allowed us to use it and
look for possible improvements and increments. We managed to get a handful of suggestions and feedback
from some users, which turned out quite applicable. First, let's take a quick look at the releases in
this phase and their changelogs.

### Releases

#### v2019.7.2

- Bug fixes.
- New license selection settings.
- Old license chooser removed and plugin linked to the [current chooser](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)
- Plugin settings page redesigned for better user experience.
- New feature to add additional text after the license.
- Gutenberg blocks for CC licenses redesigned.
- Added customization settings for Gutenberg blocks for backend and front end.

#### v2019.8.1

- Re-wrote license widget for the plugin. Added option to display the default license
 as a widget or in the footer.
- Refactored and improved code quality.
- Submitted plugin to WordPress.org for review.

#### v2019.8.2

- All necessary Default/Site license settings added.
- Plugin settings page design completed.
- Rich-text components added to previously static Gutenberg blocks converted to allow attribution of any content.
- Gutenberg blocks redesigned to include settings.
- Security improvements.
- i18n improvements.
- Minor bug fixes and refinements.

### Blocks

The CC blocks are now editable with a bunch of options. We integrated rich-text in each block, which
 renders a rich content-editable input, providing users with the option to format the content.
 This makes sure that the requirements of describing the title, author and the source
 while using a CC licensed content can be met..

### Re-designed Settings

The redesigned plugin settings are straightforward and have every required field. We have added widget as a display
option, which is much better than previous footer implementation.
