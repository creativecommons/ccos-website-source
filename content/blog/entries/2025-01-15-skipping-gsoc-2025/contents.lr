The Creative Commons (CC) technology team regrets to announce **we will not be
participating in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025**. While the program remains
excellent, we do not have the resources to participate this year and meet our
core responsibilities.

We are grateful to Google for the program and have found incredible value in
participating in past years. We look forward to participating in future years.
We are thankful for the work and time of contributors. This is not an exciting
announcement, but we will be better equipped to engage with work programs in
the future.


## Preparing to re-engage

In addition to revamping our CC Open Source website during the first quarter of
this year, we will also be refreshing our structured community involvement, and
improving our project lead resources.

Our CC Open Source website is in the process of being updated to be less
technologically complex and to leverage the current Vocabulary design system
([creativecommons/vocabulary][vocabulary]).

Our structured community involvement has languished since the technology team
was downsized due to the COVID pandemic (202-12-07 [Upcoming Changes to the CC
Open Source Community — Creative Commons Open Source][changes]). We will be
simplifying community involvement so that we can be more responsive with
increased visibility.

The most resource intensive period of a work program is the application phase.
During this time there is a deluge of activity that has often exceeded our
capacity. Developing our project lead resources will allow us to better set
expectations, ease communications, and better point applicants on productive
trajectories.
