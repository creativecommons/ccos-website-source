Quantifying the Commons

University of Michigan, School of Information


## Project Objective and Problem Statement

Creative Commons (CC) has over one billion licensed works. However, there is no
central data or organization of CC’s licensed works, making it difficult to
quantify the number of works and to analyze which licenses are useful or should
be retired. The goal of this project is to help CC staff identify redundant
licenses and use quantitative data in marketing its impact. It focuses on Open Education Resources (OER).


## Data Collection

Data was collected from [OER Commons][oercommons], which is one of CC’s
platforms and a library containing digital education resources. The first step
in data collection was identifying which licenses this data source uses and how
many works are under each license within OER Commons. OER Commons uses the
licenses CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-ND, CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-NC-SA, and CC-BY-NC-ND
which contribute to both ‘fair use’ and ‘commercial use’ assets, respectively.
The next step in data collection was querying the Application Programming
Interface (API) by license. In order to retrieve all works for a license,
queries are batched by a maximum of 50 works retrieved at once.  This process
is repeated until all works for a license are retrieved. These steps are run
for every license. For every API call, the response is in XML which is parsed
for features including education level, subject area, material type, media
format, languages, primary user, and educational use. The results are outputted
to a tab-separated CSV file.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After collecting all of our data, we began exploring the different columns in
our dataframe. In particular, we looked at the distribution of different
languages, the distribution of items by license type, and when items were added
to the OER Commons API. Through this exploration, we were able to further
specify our analysis and dig deeper into the different relationships of the
data.


### Diagram #1:

![Diagram #1: Percentage of Items per License Type](diagram_01.png)

Diagram #1 shows the distribution of items taken from OER Commons by license
type. It is clear that the CC-BY license type is the most popular, with 43% of
the items having that license type. The CC-BY-SA license is also fairly
popular, accounting for 27% of the items collected.


### Diagram #2:

![Diagram #2: Number of Items by Month since Dec 2015](diagram_02.png)

Diagram #2 shows when items have been added to the OER Commons API. There is
little activity from December 2015, up to the beginning of 2023. However, close
to 30,000 items were added to the API in early 2023.


### Diagram #3:

![Diagram #3: Percentage of Items by Language](diagram_03.png)

Diagram #3 shows the percentage of items by language. English is the most used
language, with about 86% of the items being in English. The other languages
each have a small amount of the items.


### Diagram #4:

![Diagram #4: Percentage of Items in English per License Type](diagram_04.png)

Since English is clearly the most popular language, we decided to see the
license distribution for items that are in English. Diagram #4 shows a similar
distribution to the pie chart depicting the overall license distribution; this
is to be expected since items in English account for 86% of all items, so the
distribution of licenses is similar to the overall distribution.


### Diagram #5:

![Diagram #5: Percentage of Items in French per License Type](diagram_05.png)

We continued to look at the distribution of licenses by each language.
Diagram #5 shows that for the items in French, CC-BY license is the most
popular at 49%, with CC-BY-SA being right behind it at 32%.


## Visualizations


### Diagram #6:

![Diagram #6: License Type Breakdown by Primary User](diagram_06.png)

Diagram #6 shows the distribution of items on OER commons by primary user and
broken down by license type. The platform predominantly contains items designed
for teachers and students, with the rest for parents, administrators,
librarians among others. The breakdown of licenses for each primary user is
relatively consistent with the overall breakdown of the platform, as seen from
the charts below (Diagram #7 and Diagram #8).


### Diagram #7:

![Diagram #7: Percentage of Items Used by Teachers per License Type](diagram_07.png)


### Diagram #8:

![Diagram #8: Percentage of Items Used by Students per License Type](diagram_08.png)


### Diagram #9:

![Diagram #9: Subject Area by License](diagram_09.png)

Another aspect analyzed was inspecting the subject areas and the licenses that
they hold as shown in Diagram #9. Some preliminary data cleaning had to be
conducted as there were too many subjects on the platform, while some subjects
had very low counts. The team grouped similar subjects into nine different
categories, for example, social science, anthropology, sociology,
communication, world cultures, psychology, women’s studies, and social work
were grouped into social sciences.

It can be seen from Diagram #9 that the most popular subject areas on the
platform are health sciences, language/arts and other sciences. Diving deeper
into these subject areas, health sciences and language/arts have a higher
proportion of items with the CC-BY-NC-SA license.


### Diagram #10:

![Diagram #10: Material Type Breakdown by Education Level](diagram_10.png)

Finally, the team analyzed the material types of the items and sorted it by
education level that the items were created for. Again, some data cleaning was
required as there were too many material types to analyze and some also had
very small data counts. The seven material types shown in Diagram #10 were the
most popular, and represented roughly 2/3 of the total.

After sorting the education levels in chronological order, an interesting trend
that emerged is that the number of items increases with education level from
preschool, hits a peak at the community college level, and then decreases
afterwards. A shift in the material types can also be drawn from the graph, as
lesson plans represent a large proportion of items from preschool to high
school, but become insignificant from the college level onwards. On the other
hand, this is replaced by a higher proportion of readings. Another observation
worth remarking is that there is also a higher proportion of items at the
college level for textbooks.


## Key Value

The insights created through the analysis of this project will be helpful for
CC’s marketing efforts. The ability to understand the distribution of license
types in different contexts such as education level, will help CC be better
equipped to target their marketing toward key demographics such as preschool
education materials for example. Another take away in terms of key value was
CC’s initiative to long term preservation. CC’s need to centralize their
collaborators' content into a database warehouse system has been an identified
direction since the start of this project. Our prototype database of the OER
Commons has contributed to these efforts in both small scale implementation as
well as meeting the scope of our database system modeling. As other CC cohort
chapters contribute their own databases of licenced works, there is a hopeful
expectation that a merger of acquisition will take place with other CC chapters
in the future.


## Next Steps

As CC expands its contributing members into the open-source initiative of
bringing licensed works to the world, other internal systems of data
preservation and maintenance start to become a point of serious interest as the
databases start to become an integrated endeavor in the future. Running our
prototype case study of the OER-Commons database has given us insights on the
direction of CC current database system and how this system will be better
suited to evolve into a data warehouse hub as a long-term solution. When we
started the process of data mining and data analysis, using Python3 has been a
staple in both our groups efforts as well as CC’s previous protocols with Git.
So, complementing this framework with other Python libraries that allow for
easier database querying will be a step in the right direction for the next
cohort of CC contributors to further this process along. An example of this
library integration would be pandasql to utilize the family pandas library
methods along with the SQL command logic that makes database maintenance easy
and manageable. Besides updating the data storage, future work can continue to
collect data from other sources with CC licensed work including the GLAM and
Internet Archive.


## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude towards Timid Robot Zehta, our client,
for working on behalf of CC, as well as [OER Commons][oercommons] for their
valuable contributions towards the development of digital licensing and open
source databasing initiatives. Without them, this project would not have been
possible. Their efforts have been instrumental in giving us the tools and
resources to help progress in the open-source initiative by allowing us to
promote the free exchange of ideas, knowledge, and resources within the art,
health, and education sectors of non-profit endeavors. Open source projects are
important because they allow the public to use and work on projects without
restrictions or keys. Since this initiative is open source, our efforts can be
added to and built upon, allowing the project to continue through the addition
of new contributors with fresh perspectives. Both of their commitment to
promoting accessible and inclusive content has enabled individuals and
organizations to create and distribute digital assets without facing any legal
restrictions around the world. It has been an absolute pleasure to work with
these organizations and be a part of their mission to democratize access to
information.
