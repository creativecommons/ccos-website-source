This year, [CC is participating in Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://creativecommons.org/2019/03/04/cc-google-summer-of-code-2019/)
 as a mentoring organization after a six year break from the program. We
 are excited to be hosting five phenomenal students (representing three
continents) who will be working on CC tech projects full-time over the
summer. Here they are!

      <p><strong>Ahmad Bilal</strong></p>

      <p><em>I am Ahmad Bilal, a Computer Science undergrad from UET Lahore,
      who likes computers, problems and using the former to solve the later. I
      am always excited about Open Source, and currently focused on Node.js,
      Serverless, GraphQL, Cloud, Gatsby.js with React.js and WordPress. I
      like organizing meetups, conferences and meeting new people. I view
      working in GSoC with Creative Commons, one of the biggest opportunities
      of my life. Cats are my weakness, and I am a sucker for well-engineered
      cars.</em></p>

      <p>Ahmad will be taking ownership of <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons-wordpress-plugin">the CC WordPress plugin</a>,
      which simplifies the process of applying CC licenses to content created
      using the popular WordPress blogging platform. He will be updating it
      to use the latest WordPress best practices, resolving open issues, and
      adding new features like integrating with CC Search. Ahmad’s mentor is
      our Core Systems Manager <a href="https://creativecommons.org/author/timidcreativecommons-org/">Timid Robot Zehta</a>, backed up by Hugo Solar.</p>

      <p>You can follow the progress of this project through the <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons-wordpress-plugin">GitHub repo</a> or on the <code>#cc-dev-wordpress</code> channel on our <a href="/community">Slack community</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Dhruv Bhanushali</strong></p>

      <p><em>I am Dhruv Bhanushali, a Mumbai-based software developer recently
       graduated from IIT Roorkee. I started programming as a hobby some five
      years ago and, having found my calling, am now am pursuing a career in
      the field. I have worked on a lot of institute-level projects and am
      excited to expand the reach of my code to a global scale with CC through
       GSoC. Apart from development, I am a huge music fan and keep my curated
       collection of music with me at all times. I also love to binge watch TV
       shows and movies, especially indie art films.</em></p>

      <p>Dhruv will be working on an original project, CC Vocabulary, which is
       a collection of UI components that make it easy to develop Creative
      Commons apps and services while ensuring a cohesive experience and
      appearance across CC projects. These components will be able to be used
      in sites built using modern JavaScript frameworks (specifically Vue.js)
      as well as simpler websites built using WordPress. CC’s Web Developer <a href="https://creativecommons.org/author/hugocreativecommons-org/">Hugo Solar</a> serves as primary mentor, with backup from Sophine Clachar.</p>

      <p>You can follow the progress of this project through the <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-vocabulary">GitHub repo</a> or on the <code>#gsoc-cc-vocabulary</code> channel on our <a href="/community/">Slack community</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>María Belén Guaranda Cabezas</strong></p>

      <p><em>Hello! My name is María, and I am an undergraduate Computer
      Science student from ESPOL, in Ecuador. I have worked for the past 2
      years as a research assistant. I have worked in projects including
      computer vision, the estimation of socio-economic indexes through CDRs
      analysis, and a machine learning model with sensors data. During my
      spare time, I like to watch animes and reading. I love sports! Specially
       soccer. I am also committed to environmental causes, and I am a huge
      fan of cats and dogs (I have 4 and 1 respectively).</em></p>

      <p>María will be working on producing visualizations of the data
      associated with more than 300 million works we have indexed in the CC
      Catalog (which powers CC Search) and how that data is interconnected.
      These visualizations will enable users to understand how much
      CC-licensed content is available on the internet, which websites host
      the most content, which CC licenses are used the most, and much more.
      She will be mentored by our Data Engineer <a href="https://creativecommons.org/author/sclachar/">Sophine Clachar</a> with backup from Breno Ferreira.</p>

      <p>You can follow the progress of this project through the <a href="https://github.com/cc-archive/cccatalog-dataviz">GitHub repo</a> or on the <code>#gsoc-cc-catalog-viz</code> channel on our <a href="/community/">Slack community</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Ari Madian</strong></p>

      <p><em>I am an 18 year old, Seattle based, mostly self taught, Computer
      Science student. I originally started programming by tinkering with
      Python, and eventually moved into C# and the .NET framework, as well as
      JS and some web development. I like Chai and Rooibos teas, volunteering
      at my local food bank, and some occasional PC gaming, among other
      things. I’m now working with Creative Commons on Google Summer of Code!</em></p>

      <p>Ari will be working on creating a modern human-centered version of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">our CC license chooser tool</a>, which is long overdue for an update. His work will focus on design and usability as well as code. CC’s Front End Engineer <a href="https://creativecommons.org/author/brenoferreira/">Breno Ferreira</a> is the primary mentor for this project with support from Alden Page.</p>

      <p><strong>Mayank Nader</strong></p>

      <p><em>I am Mayank Nader, a sophomore Computer Science student from
      India. Currently, my main area of interest is Python scripting,
      JavaScript development, backend, and API development. I also like to
      experiment with bash scripting and ricing and configuring my Linux
      setup. Apart from that, I like listening to music and watching movies,
      documentaries, and tv shows. I am very much inspired by Open Source and
      try to contribute whenever I can.</em></p>

      <p>Mayank will be working on building a cross-platform browser plugin
      that allows users to search CC-licensed works directly from the browser
      and enable reuse of those works by providing easy image attribution
      tools. Users will be able to find content to use without having to
      switch to a new website. Mayank will be mentored by CC’s Software
      Engineer <a href="https://creativecommons.org/author/aldencreativecommons-org/">Alden Page</a> with support from Timid Robot Zehta.</p>
