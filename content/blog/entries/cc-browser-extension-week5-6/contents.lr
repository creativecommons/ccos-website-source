For the context, I am working on my GSoC project that is to make a browser-extension to search CC Licensed content in the public domain by interacting with CC Catalog API.

### Work Done
These couple weeks were spent on finishing the filter section, setting up infinite-scroll and fixing issues and bugs after some days of testing.

Most of the filter section was complete but I missed a tiny detail that the Catalog API [does not accept](https://api.creativecommons.engineering/image/search?q=hello&li=cc0&lt=commercial) both the license and use-case filter queries in the same request. I did some changes in the code for generating the valid URL for every filter action and added the relevant UI changes of deselecting and disabling the license drop-down when a use-case is selected.

The infinite scroll was set-up by following the classic solution of firing another request to the API when the user scrolls to the bottom and appending the thumbnails of the result in the grid.

I tested the extension for a couple of days and made some [bug reports](https://github.com/creativecommons/ccsearch-browser-extension/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) on Github. Most of them were pretty easy to fix but the one I struggled with was [this](https://github.com/creativecommons/ccsearch-browser-extension/issues/3) one. After some discussion, [Breno](https://creativecommons.org/author/brenoferreira/) and [Dhruv](https://github.com/dhruvkb) suggested using the [Masonry grid](https://masonry.desandro.com/) for the thumbnails (I was previously using the standard float grid of 3 columns). I made the transition but observed some flickering in the images on firefox when a new batch loaded on scrolling. It was working fine on chrome though. I spent a whole day looking for alternatives or doing some silly fix by using a bunch of timeouts. Again, Breno and Druv came to the rescue and suggested that some animations may be causing this. But even after a few hours of hit and trial and removing and fixing animations, I couldn't fix it only because I was looking in the wrong place. By changing the `transitionDuration` option of masonry to `0` did the trick. In fact, it was the first thing I should have tried. I should maybe take breaks more often to clear my mind :p

### Coming Up
- Work on showing relevant image info when we click on the image.
- Let users copy the rich-text or HTML version of the attribution with one click.
- Add the download buttons to download the image and the attribution.

You can check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/cc-archive/ccsearch-browser-extension) and join the discussion on Zulip [updated 2025-09-23].
