The [CC Global Network](https://network.creativecommons.org) website is the face of our global community; it is the home for a community of advocates, activists, scholars, artists, and users working to strengthen the Commons worldwide.
One of our organizational goals regarding the global network is to “create value for members, toward impact at global scale” and that’s why we plan on redesigning the Global Network website.

## Increase value for members
When we think of a website focused on members and their possible needs, we have to think about how different users interact with the website. We established three differents users/personas:

- *Not logged in users:* users looking for global network general information or how to begin the sign up process
- *Logged in but not approved yet*: users looking for information about their membership approval status
- *Logged in and approved members*: users utilizing the site’s search function and contacting other members


Keeping this in mind, three differents homepages were designed according to each identified profile.

## Improved user search

We listened to the community feedback and developed a major revamp of the member section. We improved the member list and the search section by adding useful filters to help identify specific people or groups of people based on a range of factors, such as nationality or language.

## Member profiles

Member profiles were redesigned to take advantage of the current metadata of users so we can show the information in a better way. In addition, the profile shows more/less information if you are/aren’t approved as a member.

## Chapters section

Giving more visibility for the local chapters’ infrastructure, this entire section was redesigned considering the network’s global reach and the necessity of easily searching for details and specific chapters. The new interface supports switching between the map and the sortable list.

## Keeping forward the global network website

This is certainly not the end of our revamp of the CC Global Network website, we're always working on giving the members a better experience by fixing bugs and updating the interface.
