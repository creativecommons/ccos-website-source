This is part 2 of a three part series.

Part 1: History and debt: The historical context that led to the newest 
refactor and release of the 2025 Chooser.
Part 2: Specifics and fixes: Breaking down the specifics of technical debt, 
issues, complexity, contextual-shift misalignment, and fixes.
Part 3: Future Growth: Whatâ€™s next for the Chooser, and what directions we 
hope to grow it.

The Creative Commons Chooser 2025 refactor offers a number of improvements 
across the surface of the application. Wherever possible we tried to consider 
if the footprint or implementation could be more straightforward and simple and 
then worked from there. The end goal being an application that would be 
considerably more flexible in its upkeep and advancement.
