## Post-Announcement

Contributor announcements have been made and you've been selected!
Congratulations! Here's what we expect you to do before the work program
officially starts:

- Continue to refine your project plan and timeline with your project lead.
- Define communication channels and set up a weekly check-in with your project
  lead.
- Set up your computer and development environment.
- Familiarize yourself with the development process at Creative Commons (pull
  requests, code review).
- Introduce yourself to the members of CC's engineering team.


## Work Program Period

Once the work program starts, here's what we expect of you:

- For large projects: Work 30-40 hours per week (or agree on a different plan
  with your mentor ahead of time).
- For medium projects: Work 15-20 hours per week (or agree on a different plan
  with your mentor ahead of time).
- Push code to GitHub frequently. Commit early and often.
- Be available on Slack whenever you are working and post at least once a
  (work)day to talk about what you're working on that day.
- Write a short update on your work **every two weeks** and post it to the CC
  technical blog ([instructions are here](/community/write-a-blog-post/)). To
  get a sense of how these posts are written and how the projects evolved, you
  can read entries done by previous [Outreachy][outreachyblogs] or [Google
  Summer of Code][gsocblogs] contributors.
- Attend your weekly check-in with your project lead and any other meetings.
- Be proactive about asking for help, especially when you're stuck.
- Ensure that you're on track to delivering your project at the end of the work
  period. If you're not on track, talk with your mentor to come up with a new
  plan for the project well before the deadline.
- Let your project lead and the organization admins know when you are going to
  be unavailable. If something sudden comes up, let us know.
