title: Improving Quantifying the Commons
---
problem:
The Quantifying the Commons project has seen excellent additions led by student
developers and contributors. A couple of data sources have been automated, but many more remain.
---
expected_outcome:
Add automated data fetching, processing, and reporting of new sources.
---
contributor_tasks:
The contributor will need to adapt or improve the data flow. New sources should
utilize the existing codebase as much as possible and ensure improvements are
implemnted consistently across sources. Challenges include quota limits that
may require multi-day/multi-step data gathering, incomplete source
documentation, and ensuring data is reported clearly. Knowledge of numpy and
matplotlib python libraries will be very helpful.
---
application_tips:
- Engage with the repository (issues, pull requests)
- Be helpful and welcoming (e.g. answer other contributorsâ€™ questions on Zulip)
