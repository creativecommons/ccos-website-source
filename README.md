REPO DIRECTLY**.

## Overview

This site is built using [Lektor][lektor]. All changes to
[https://creativecommons.github.io][ccgithubio] must be made **here** and
deployed via lektor (see [Deployment](#deployment), below).

[lektor]:https://www.getlektor.com/
[ccgithubio]:https://creativecommons.github.io


## Installation

1. Make sure you have [pipenv][pipenvdocs] installed.
1. Clone this repository.
1. Open your command line interface and `cd` to the repository root directory.
1. Run `pipenv install` to create a Python virtual environment and install the
   requirements for this project.

[pipenvdocs]:https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


### pipenv Troubleshooting

`pipenv` doesn't always provide the best error messages ([Provide better error
message if the projectâ€™s virtual environment is broken][pipenverror]). If all
else fails, try removing the virtual environment and reinstalling:
1. `pipenv --rm`
2. `pipenv install`

[pipenverror]:https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1918


## Development

1. Run `pipenv shell` to spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated.
2. Run `lektor server -f webpack` to start the Lektor development server. You will be able
   to see the website at [`http://localhost:5000/`][lektorlocal]. The Lektor
   server will rebuild the site every time you change any content.

## Deployment

We have continuous deployment set up. Travis CI builds and deploys the site
 whenever it detects new commits on the `master` branch.


### Manual Deployment

When you are ready to deploy a new version of the site, run `lektor deploy`
(assuming you have your GitHub SSH key already set up and you have access to
the [creativecommons.github.io][ccghiorepo] repository). That's it, it's live
on production!


## Project Structure

Here's how the code is structured in the top level of the repository:
- **`assets`**: This directory contains the JavaScript and CSS files for the
  project built via webpack. Most of the JavaScript and CSS is third-party code and loaded via CDN so this is pretty empty.
- **`content`**: The content of the site lives here. [Here's an explanation of
  how content works in Lektor][lektorcontent]. This is probably what you'll be
  modifying most often.
- **`models`**: [All content in Lektor is associated with data
  models][lektormodels] to define their schema. Currently, we only use the
  default `page` model that ships with Lektor.
- **`templates`**: This is where the [Jinja2][jinja2] templates that render
  content are stored. See the [Lektor template documentation][lektortemplate]
  for more information.
- **`webpack`**: This is where all the webpack config files as well as Sass and 
  JavaScript files for the project resides. The JavaScript and Sass files are compiled and saved in assets folder       during lektor build process.
